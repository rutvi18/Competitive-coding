Given a matrix of m x n and a folding direction, determine what the matrix will look like when folded in the given way.


Given four points on a piece of paper, assume the top left corner has a value of 1, and going in a clockwise direction, each corner increases in value by 1.



Input Format

- The first line is the number of test cases (t)
- The first line of each test case is the size of the matrix (m n)
- The second line of each test case is the folding direction from point c to d
- For the next m lines, each line is the row of that matrix with n values

Constraints

- 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 4 and c ≠ d
- 1 ≤ m, n, t ≤ 1,000,000
- 0 ≤ value inside the matrix (v) ≤ 9
- When folded, if the value of vij that is folded over vi'j' are not the same, we considered it asymmetrical (see Sample 3)
- If a side has the size of 1, we cannot fold perpendicularly to that side.

Output Format

For each test case, print the number of the test case starting with 1 followed by the list the resulting matrix of the folded paper. Use a hyphen symbol (-) for disappearing spaces. If the paper cannot be folded symmetrically, list “error.”

Sample Input 1

1
1 1
1 2
0

Sample Output 1

1
error

Sample Output 1 Explanation

The matrix has size 1x1, so it’s not foldable.



Sample Input 2

1
3 3
1 3
0 1 2
1 3 1
2 1 0

Sample Output 2

1
--2
-31
210

Sample Output 2 Explanation

If we fold it from corner 1 to corner 3, the numbers match the opposite numbers, so we can fold it symmetrically. The top left part has disappeared, so it is replaced with a hyphen symbol (-) in the output.



Sample Input 3

1
1 2
1 2
5 6

Sample Output 3

1
error

Sample Output 3 Explanation

We have a foldable matrix. However, when we fold from corner 1 to corner 2, the values inside the matrix are different (5 and 6), so we cannot fold it symmetrically.



Sample Input 4

1
1 3
1 2
1 2 1

Sample Output 4

1
-21

Sample Output 4 Explanation

The numbers match each other in the opposite side.
